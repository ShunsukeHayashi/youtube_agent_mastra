# Add Tests for YouTube Mastra Workflows

## Summary
- Add test files for previously untested workflows
- Create test templates that can be adapted for similar workflow types
- Implement comprehensive test coverage for all major workflow components

## Added Tests
- `longFormRoadmap.test.ts`: Test for the YouTube Long Form Roadmap Workflow
- `contentScoring.test.ts`: Test for the YouTube Content Scoring Workflow
- `shortsIdeation.test.ts`: Test for the YouTube Shorts Ideation Workflow

## Test Strategy
Each test file follows a consistent pattern:
1. Proper mocking of dependencies (Agent, AI models, createStep)
2. Basic initialization tests to verify workflow properties
3. Successful execution tests with mock input/output data
4. Error handling tests
5. Input validation tests

## Testing Plan
- Run these tests to verify basic functionality
- Use these test files as templates to create tests for the remaining untested workflows
- Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline

## Notes
These tests are designed to work with Jest and follow the existing testing patterns in the codebase. They test the workflow interfaces but do not test the internal implementation details, which allows for flexibility in implementation changes.
